# About :information_source:

Want to learn [command syntax](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/cli-pages), [hierichy structure](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/directory-pages) and command configs? Then this
project is for you! Don't just copy-paste things, learn them. :smile:

> :bell: Note for programmers: all pages are written in a [parsable way](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/syntax/blob/main/base.md) so
> it's possible automatically extract some data from them to handle it.

## Expectations from the end user :books:

We assume that the end user is already familiar with some programming stuff. To
be more precise we expect all page syntax to be understandable by default no
matter it what. When we encounter some repetetive problem we standardize a way
to solve it. We don't handle each page specificly.

## Contributions :hammer_and_wrench:

Each repository contains link to it's contributing guide (named CONTRIBUTING.md)
where you can learn how to get started with writing your own pages, [themes](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/themes)
or [tools](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/v2-tooling).

## Current goals :checkered_flag:

Current goals are listed in each repo separately like [here](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/cli-pages#current-goals-checkered_flag).
